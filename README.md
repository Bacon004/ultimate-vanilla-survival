# Ultimate Vanilla Survival

## Day 0
After wandering a few hundred blocks form spawn I've found this cool cliff. I'm thinking
I'll build a cool fortress here one day. For now, I'll need to set up shelter.

## Day 1
One night has passed so far. I've made this small home just inside a cave.

While mining some iron further down in the, I found a mineshaft.

## Day 17
For the last while I've been working on building an actual house to live in. It seems a bit
flat though, so I'll need to spend some time working on the design.

Around back, I've been growing some food and building materials.
